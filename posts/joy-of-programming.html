          <h2>Finding Joy in Programming in the Age of LLM's</h2>
          <article>
            <p>
              I love writing code. I enjoy the actual act of typing the syntax
              of different programming languages into a text editor. I enjoy the
              feeling and sound of the keyboard, googling syntax questions,
              searching for the answer to bugs, and debugging a complicated
              program. The feeling of solving a complicated coding problem after
              hours, sometimes days, of searching for an answer is unmatched. Of
              course, all of these hours spent spelunking the web for answers
              aren't wasted. I almost always end up with a greater understanding
              of the underlying technology/language/framework that I'm
              researching. And when I "finish" a project (are personal projects
              ever
              <i>really</i>
              finished?), I get the absolute pleasure of actually seeing and
              interacting with the results of my hard work. All of these things
              bring me much joy.

              I have been thinking a lot about how much I love coding, and how
              lucky I am to be able to do this for a living. Unfortunately, as
              agents and agentic coding become more commonplace, coding without
              the assistance of an LLM seems to be coming to an end. I'm
              certainly not anti-AI and I use claude everyday to code (LLM's are
              amazing technology!). When I use an LLM to write code for/with me,
              I've found the experience to be a bit less enjoyable compared to
              the "old" way of writing code pre-LLM's. I don't get that "AHA!"
              moment if I use the LLM to debug for me or when reviewing the
              generated code. I don't get the dopamine hit that comes from
              thinking deeply about difficult problems and finally figuring a
              solution to some bug. I don't think I gain as much
              knowledge/understanding of the code as I would have from reading
              through docs, blog posts, or stack overflow comments from other
              developers that are smarter than me who have encountered these
              problems already. The plus side of this is that AI enables me to
              build things much faster, which is awesome!
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              With that said, I'm interested to see what happens in the future
              as there seems to be increasing pressure for developers to use
              LLM's and agents to generate all/most of their code. Even if this
              is not strictly enforced (although in some companies, it already
              <a href="https://x.com/tobi/status/1909251946235437514">is</a>
              ), there is the concern that those that don't use LLM's might be
              viewed as less productive than the LLM users.

              It's clear that for better or for worse, generative AI is here to
              stay. While it's a bit sad to me that the ultimate result of LLM's
              in software development is the "death" of crafting good,
              maintainable, quality code by hand; I'm also excited to see what
              the future brings and what new software people will be capable of
              building with these incredible tools. For the time being, when
              working on personal projects, I tend to minimize my LLM usage.
              Especially when learning a new language/technology, I find this
              gives me a deeper understanding of things. Then, once I am more
              proficient on my own, I find I'm able to move faster and with more
              confidence when equipped with an LLM. I'm hopeful that whatever
              the future brings, I will continue to learn about computers and
              experience the joy of programming.
