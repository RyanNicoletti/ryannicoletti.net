          <h2>Finding Joy in Programming in the Age of LLM's</h2>
          <article>
            <p>
              I love writing code. I enjoy the actual act of typing the syntax
              of different programming languages into a text editor. I enjoy the
              feeling and sound the keyboard, googling syntax questions,
              searching for the answer to bugs, and debugging a complicated
              program. The feeling of solving a complicated coding problem after
              hours, sometimes days, of searching for an answer is unmatched. Of
              course, all of these hours spent spelunking the web for answers
              aren't wasted. I almost always end up with a greater understanding
              of the underlying technology/language/framework that I'm
              researching. And when I "finish" a project (are personal projects
              every
              <i>really</i> finished?), I get the absolute pleasure of actually
              seeing and interacting with the results of my hard work. All of
              these things bring me much joy.

              I have been thinking a lot about how much I love coding, and how
              lucky I am to be able to do this for a living. Unfortunately, as
              agents and agentic coding become more common place, coding without
              the assistance of an LLM seems to be coming to an end. I'm
              certainly not anti-AI and I use claude everyday to code. When I
              use an LLM to write code for/with me, I've found the experience to
              be much less enjoyable. I don't get that "AHA!" moment if I use
              the LLM to debug for me or when reviewing the generated code. I
              don't get the dopamine hit that comes from thinking deeply about
              difficult problems and finally figuring whatever it is out. I
              don't gain any knowledge along the way as I would have from
              reading through documentation, blog posts, or stack overflow
              comments from developers that are smarter than me who have
              encountered these problems already. I'm just left with some good
              enough code that usually mostly works.
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              I fear that there seems to be ever increasing pressure for
              developers to abandon writing code by hand and use LLM's to
              generate all code. Even if this is not strictly enforced (although
              in some companies, it already is
              <a href="https://x.com/tobi/status/1909251946235437514"
                >companies</a
              >), there is the concern that those that don't use LLM's might be
              viewed as less productive than the LLM users.
            </p>

            <p>
              It's clear that for better or for worse, generative AI is here to
              stay. It deeply saddens me that ultimate result of introducing
              LLM's into the world of professional software development is the
              death of the craft of writing truly good, maintainable, quality
              code. At the very least, when I work on personal projects, I can
              choose to minimize my LLM usage. I get to struggle through both
              trivial and complicated bugs. I get to learn and grow as a
              programmer and continue on the path towards mastery. I get to
              learn about how computers work and experience the joy of
              programming.
