                        Why I Changed Careers from Vet Med to Software
                        Development
                    </h2>
                    <article>
                        <p>
                            Three years ago, I accepted a job offer for a
                            software developer position. At the time, I was
                            working as a veterinarian in a small animal vet
                            hospital. Quite the career pivot. I often get asked
                            why I made such a drastic career change, especially
                            after all the schooling/training involved in
                            becoming a vet, and sometimes have trouble answering
                            that question, despite knowing it was the right
                            decision. This post is mostly an attempt to
                            articulate the reason for this career change.

                        <h3>The Path to Veterinary Medicine</h3>
                        <p>
                            I, like many vets, became a veterinarian because
                            I've loved animals ever since I was a kid. I started
                            working at a local vet hospital in high school as an
                            assistant. There I met a veterinary oncologist who
                            also happened to work at the NIH doing comparative
                            oncology research. Eventually, I landed myself a
                            summer internship in his lab, assisting with his
                            research. The idea of being able to help people or
                            make breakthroughs in human medicine by studying
                            animal models was intriguing, and as an introvert, I
                            enjoyed working in the lab doing bench work.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            During this time I was encouraged to pursue higher
                            education by my mentor as well as my parents. This
                            meant some type of graduate school either a PhD or
                            PhD + vet school. In my last year of college I was
                            offered a position in the lab at NIH as a postbac
                            research fellow. I had also applied and was accepted
                            into vet school. While I wasn't sure exactly what
                            type of career I wanted to pursue, working on
                            cutting edge cancer research was certainly an
                            intriguing opportunity. At the end of the day,
                            pressure from family led me to accept the veterinary
                            school offer, afraid I'd never go back to school and
                            become a vet later if I didn't go then (in
                            hindsight, that probably wouldn't have been such a
                            bad thing).
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            I graduated from veterinary school in 2017 and went
                            on to complete two years of additional training
                            (internships) thinking I wanted to pursue a
                            residency in oncology, then a PhD, following in the
                            footsteps of my mentor from the NIH. Pretty quickly,
                            I realized veterinary medicine as a whole was just
                            not for me. I abandoned the idea of a residency and
                            started working as a general practice vet. I also
                            started learning to code and began the long journey
                            of changing careers and leaving behind full-time
                            work as a vet, after 6 long years of vet school and
                            internships. So the question is, why?
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <h3>The Human Factor</h3>
                        <p>
                            I'm often asked by summer students or assistants if
                            I would recommend becoming a veterinarian. I usually
                            echo what I've heard other vets say to similar
                            questions: "if there's literally anything else you
                            can imagine yourself doing, you should pursue that
                            instead, otherwise, maybe you should become a vet".
                            I also ask them if the idea of talking to people for
                            10 hours a day sounds appealing. If not, it's
                            probably not the right profession to get into. Of
                            course, veterinarians interact with animals every
                            day too: physical exams, procedures, and surgery are
                            part of the job; but those tasks didn't fulfill my
                            love for animals the way people often assume they
                            would. If anything, it made me like animals less
                            than I used to; or at least be more weary of them.
                            Veterinary medicine, in my opinion, is about 90%
                            working with and managing people and 10% working
                            with animals (who are occasionally trying to bite
                            and/or scratch your face off).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Communication and education occur constantly with
                            pet owners, understandably so, as our patients can't
                            communicate or advocate for themselves. This means
                            when you're seeing 20-25 appointments every day, you
                            have 20-25 conversations with different people.
                            These conversations can often be mentally and/or
                            emotionally taxing: limited finances, optimal
                            treatment options (for both the pet and the owner),
                            discussion of prognosis, euthanasia.. Managing
                            expectations can also be difficult: it's possible we
                            might not find an answer even after running costly
                            diagnostics, leading to increased frustration for
                            pet owners. At the same time, we must manage any
                            hospitalized patients, field phone calls, and
                            delegate staff. At the end of most days, I found my
                            'social battery' to be running on empty.

                        <h3>Lack of Personal Connection</h3>
                        <p>
                            Despite deeply caring about every patient I see and
                            working with owners towards optimal outcomes, I
                            struggled to find passion within the profession.
                            Over the past nearly decade of practicing, I've
                            found there to be a big difference between loving
                            animals and being passionate about veterinary
                            medicine. In light of that, I've accepted that it's
                            something that can't be forced. I will of course
                            always like animals; but I don't think I'll ever
                            find passion in veterinary medicine as a profession.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <h3>The Operational Challenges</h3>
                        <p>
                            Throughout my time working as a veterinarian,
                            whether full-time, part-time or relief, in corporate
                            practices or private practice, staffing issues have
                            been a constant problem. Being a veterinary
                            technician is hard work, and unfortunately, unlike
                            in human medicine where being a nurse requires a
                            degree and returns a good salary, being a veterinary
                            technician nets on average roughly $20-30/hr
                            <a href="#fn1" id="ref1">[1]</a>.
                            <br />
                            It's no surprise then that long hours, physical and
                            emotional stress, and low pay (among other things)
                            frequently lead to burnout among veterinary
                            technicians and assistants. This leads to frequent
                            turnover, which results in many untrained or newly
                            trained technicians and assistants. One of the
                            results of this cycle is that both veterinarians and
                            experienced technicians are then left to compensate
                            for others' gaps in knowledge/reliability (leading
                            to more stress, long hours, etc...).
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <h3>Personal Misalignment</h3>
                        <p>
                            Overall, I found my ideal work environment involves
                            deep technical collaboration rather than continuous
                            client-facing interactions. I excel in discussions
                            with developers, stakeholders, and managers to solve
                            technical problems, communicate requirements, and
                            translate those requirements into robust systems.
                            Work that allows for both focused problem solving
                            and meaningful, focused techinical dialogue. I
                            discovered (albeit 20 years late) that I could
                            actually make a career out of my lifelong
                            fascination with computers and technology. I found
                            joy in creating and building things that people will
                            use and solving complex problems by writing code and
                            building software. Perhaps most importantly, I've
                            found that when I encounter a difficult problem in
                            software development, instead of frustration, I'm
                            genuinely excited. It's an opportunity to learn, to
                            improve, to build something better. I found passion
                            in this new career.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            While changing careers wasn't easy, I have no
                            regrets about the path that led me here. Had I not
                            become a veterinarian, I wouldn't have met my wife
                            when we both worked at the same hospital. My time in
                            veterinary medicine also taught me about
                            communication, working under pressure, and complex
                            problem solving, valuable skills in my current
                            career and in life in general. I dont discourage
                            anyone from becoming a veterinarian. Rather, I'd
                            encourage anyone who's unsure of their career to
                            consider what truly energizes you and to pursue work
                            that aligns with who you really are.
