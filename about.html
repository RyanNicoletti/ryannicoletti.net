                    I'm a veterinarian and software developer currently living
                    in Northern Virginia. I graduated from veterinary school in
                    2017 and practiced full time as a small animal vet for 5-6
                    years before changing careers. Currently, I work as a
                    software developer and occasionally work at as a
                    veterinarian on weekends.

                <h3>About This Site</h3>
                <p>
                    This website is a simple static site served by
                    <a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy</a>. It's
                    self-hosted on a little
                    <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/">Raspberry Pi</a>
                    that sits on my desk. Just HTML, CSS, and a tiny bit of
                    JavaScript. The source code is viewable on my github at
                    <a

                <h3>Indie Web</h3>
                <p>
                    The
                    <a href="https://indieweb.org/">indie web</a>
                    consists of websites created, owned, and maintained by
                    individuals. It's a niche alternative idea to what most
                    people know as the modern web. One of the main principles of
                    the indie web community, is having ownership over your own
                    domain, website, and data. I've always been a fan of the
                    "web 1.0", before it was over taken by a few large social
                    media and advertising companies and was more just a place to
                    share information.

                    This website is my small contribution to the indie web. I
                    use it to share things I write about and projects I'm
                    working on, as well as to share other websites I find
                    interesting.
