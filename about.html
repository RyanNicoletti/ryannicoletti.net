          I'm a veterinarian and software developer currently living in Northern
          Virginia. I graduated from veterinary school in 2017 and practiced
          full time as a small animal vet for 5-6 years before changing careers.
          Now, I work full time as a software developer and occasionally work as
          a vet on weekends.

        <h3>Indie Web</h3>
        <p>
          The
          <a href="https://indieweb.org/">indie web</a>
          consists of websites created, owned, and maintained by individuals.
          It's a niche alternative idea to what most people know as the modern
          web. One of the main principles of the indie web community, is having
          ownership over your own domain, website, and data. I've always been a
          fan of the "old web", before it was (mostly) taken over by a few large
          social media and advertising companies, and was more just a place to
          share information.
          <br />
          <br />
          This website is my small contribution to the indie web. I use it to
          share things I write about and projects I'm working on, as well as to
          share other websites I find interesting.
